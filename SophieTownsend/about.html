                            <p> Sophie trained as a florist fifteen years ago in New Zealand under the colourful and creative eye of Nicole Kayrouz. She ran Nicole's florist shop on a day-to-day basis and has been arranging flowers for weddings in the UK and overseas for over ten years. She recently completed a Jane Packer advanced design course and loves choosing the best quality blooms for her designs directly from New Covent Garden flower market. She launched Sophie Townsend Flowers in 2013 and was originally based in London, before relocating to the South coast in 2014.</p>
                            <p>Being married herself, Sophie knows how important it is for everything to be just right on this special day. She loves working closely with the bride and family to make sure the flowers perfectly compliment you and your venue. Her preferred style is to let the natural beauty of flowers shine through using seasonal and local flowers where available. She creates beautiful designs whatever the budget and covers Bournemouth, Poole, the New Forest and surrounding areas.</p>
                            <p>Why not contact Sophie for a <a href="./index.html#contact">free consultation</a>? She would be delighted to talk through your ideas.</p>
