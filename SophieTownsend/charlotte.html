                            <p>Charlotte and Louis chose a fantastic location for their big day and choices were made with great care and attention to detail to create a beautiful and intimate setting for their guests to relax in and enjoy.</p>
                            <p>Flower colours used were pastel pinks, blues and creams to reflect The Ballet School setting with the addition of fresh ferns and wild foliage to link to the spectacular Richmond Park which surrounds the school.</p>
                            <p>The beautiful dance studio where guests could congratulate the bride and groom, had a statement mantle piece arrangement in the blues, pinks and creams of the theme.</p>

                            <p>Guests enjoyed champagne and canapes in the entrance hall where pretty flower jars adorned the dressing tables and furniture.

                            <p>In addition, every place setting had new season blue lavender stems tucked into napkins to represent the family's holiday retreat next to a lavender farm to provide a gorgeous scent for their guests all night long.</p>
